This is a project inspiered by Terrain3D where i missed the ability to place objects on the terrain. 
Big shout out to the creators of Terrain3D its a awesome tool.
With this tool you can add any packedScene to the terrain by just one mouse click you can scroll with the 
mouse wheel through your assets (packedScens node3Ds) to change the object to place.
The easiest way to see how it works is just to download the project and test it on your own.
There is also a tutorial how to use it.
